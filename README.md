## Stakeholders

- They personally feel like they would not use our proposed app idea.
- They would rather talk to friends to feel uplifted than anonymous strangers.
- Believes that going outside more correlates to improved mood.

### Office Worker who works remotely. - End User
#### Date: 9/21/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Talks to people in person at the gym every day.
- Feels pretty good in a week and attributes it to talking with friends everyday
- It is harder to put themselves out to strangers than people they know.
- They feel that they like interacting on Discord a lot because a lot of servers act like community hubs; kind of acting as a proxy for being in person with other people.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- They feel that an anonymous person being in a similar situation would not make them easier to open up.
- Would use our app because they don’t want to receive or send anonymous messages.
- They feel that the issue they have with Discord is that it can be hard joining into on very active conversations, and they often don't stay on topic of the channel.
- It is hard to form lasting connections in anonymous chat.



### Discord and Twitch TV moderator - Moderator
#### Date: 9/23/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Users should clearly be able to find tools for reporting and providing feedback to the moderators.
- Rules of the community should be clearly stated and easily visible for users.
- Having a platform where tools can easily be added for moderation will help tremendously.
- A user should get a clear confirmation from reports, stating that the report has been submitted or even next steps taken by the team.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- Differentiating between hurtful remarks and playful comments can be challenging due to language nuances, like sarcasm.
- Handling the feelings of the user can be challenging due to different perceptions and emotions. Maintaining neutrality can be difficult.
- Determining the severity of punishment is hard when rules and consequences are not clearly defined in the community.
- Achieving consistency in punishments for moderators can be hard without set rules or if the moderators have different opinions on a matter.
#### Other notes:
##### Tools and Features used by Moderators:
- Timeouts
- Bans
- Chat history accessibility
- Warnings
##### Efficient feedback systems:
- Community rules and guidelines with consequences clearly listed
- Using both bot and human moderators to address simple and complex situations
- Consistency and fairness in decisions
##### Criteria for Inappropriate Content
- Based on community rules, and common sense (e.g. Racism, direct insults)
- Bots can detect inappropriate language well
- Context and chat log analysis
##### Severity of Punishments
- Severity is determined based on past behavior, type of violation, intent, community comfort, number of reports and other methods...
##### Regulating Bots
- Bots often spam links, including scams and adverts
- Blacklisting words or specific counter-bots are effective in addressing such issues

### Computer Science Student - End User
#### Date: 9/25/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Users should be able their information to be annonymous (everything but age, possibly)
- Feels like users should be able to filter the kind of affirmations or help they receieve
- Feels like the app should have a way to send affirmations to both friends and strangers
- Users should receieve content warnings (that is set by the user) when necessary
- This app would be a good way to make connections in their vicinity
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- Filtering out hateful words can be an issue as controlling that would be important to maintain a safe space
- A user can share an exoerience that is traumatizing for another user and its important to take that into consideration
- Receieving similar words of encouragement from users can become repetitive
#### Other notes:
- An app that mainly focuses on notifications would be more benefical for them
  - They barely open the 'affirmation' app they use but looks forward to the notifications
  - Users should be allowed to set the amount of notifications they receieve.
- For them, the aesthetic does not matter (customization, fancy color palettes, etc.)
  - They would prefer a simple, nonclustered UI
- They would like to be able to customize the proximity for recieving or sending messages (somewhere between 800 feet - 0.5 miles)
- They like taking video logs (on a native app) to help them truly know what words or phrases make them feel a certain way
  - They prefer this over a voice memo to see their progression on their facial reaction to certain phrases, words, or experiences
  - A professional, licensed therapist advised them to do try this
- They would like quick or templated responses and/or emoji reactions as well

### Stressed Finance Student - End User
#### Date: 9/25/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Users should be encouraged to share with honesty and open understanding.
- Something that rewards positivity and actively discourages negative responses via some system (vote, medals, etc)
- A safe environment that is free from any form of discrimination or bigotry.
- Would like the app to add some form of progression for people with long-term goals.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- Worried that higher accessibility would give malicious individuals a platform to target vulnerable people.
- Worried that heavy moderation might feel close to an invasion of privacy.
- Even people with good intentions might give unhelpful advice or actively harmful advice.
- Not everyone wants their advice the same way. Some people would like to be more straightforward, while others may want comfort.
#### Other notes:
- The app should be relaxing and cozy.
  - No flashing lights or large pop-ups. Avoid things that may overwhelm users, especially for those with disabilities.
  - Customization should be important as it allows users to create their own safe space.
- Daily logs and prompts that asks updates from the user to check on their progress.
  - Daily gratitutes/methods of daily reflection.
- Feels that they would not share serious issues on the app, but claims it is not necessarily a bad thing.
  - "Sometimes people have petty problems that bother them, but are afraid of dumping these struggles on their friends. Anonymity lets them trade advice for smaller problems."
