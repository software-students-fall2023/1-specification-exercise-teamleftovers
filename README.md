### Office Worker who works remotely. - End User
#### Date: 9/21/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Talks to people in person at the gym every day.
- Feels pretty good in a week and attributes it to talking with friends everyday
- It is harder to put themselves out to strangers than people they know.
- They feel that they like interacting on Discord a lot because a lot of servers act like community hubs; kind of acting as a proxy for being in person with other people.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- They feel that an anonymous person being in a similar situation would not make them easier to open up.
- Would use our app because they don’t want to receive or send anonymous messages.
- They feel that the issue they have with Discord is that it can be hard joining into on very active conversations, and they often don't stay on topic of the channel.
- It is hard to form lasting connections in anonymous chat.



### Discord and Twitch TV moderator - Moderator
#### Date: 9/23/2023
#### Goals/Needs:
- Users should clearly be able to find tools for reporting and providing feedback to the moderators.
- Rules of the community should be clearly stated and easily visible for users.
- Having a platform where tools can easily be added for moderation will help tremendously.
- A user should get a clear confirmation from reports, stating that the report has been submitted or even next steps taken by the team.
#### Problems/Frustrations:
- Differentiating between hurtful remarks and playful comments can be challenging due to language nuances, like sarcasm.
- Handling the feelings of the user can be challenging due to different perceptions and emotions. Maintaining neutrality can be difficult.
- Determining the severity of punishment is hard when rules and consequences are not clearly defined in the community.
- Achieving consistency in punishments for moderators can be hard without set rules or if the moderators have different opinions on a matter.
#### Other notes:
##### Tools and Features used by Moderators:
- Timeouts
- Bans
- Chat history accessibility
- Warnings
##### Efficient feedback systems:
- Community rules and guidelines with consequences clearly listed
- Using both bot and human moderators to address simple and complex situations
- Consistency and fairness in decisions
##### Criteria for Inappropriate Content
- Based on community rules, and common sense (e.g. Racism, direct insults)
- Bots can detect inappropriate language well
- Context and chat log analysis
##### Severity of Punishments
- Severity is determined based on past behavior, type of violation, intent, community comfort, number of reports and other methods...
##### Regulating Bots
- Bots often spam links, including scams and adverts
- Blacklisting words or specific counter-bots are effective in addressing such issues
